This project demonstrates how to automate the deployment of a 
static website to an AWS EC2 instance using GitHub Actions 
where my secret variables are set up

It showcases a practical CI/CD pipeline where code is pushed to the 
GitHub repository is automatically deployed to a configured EC2 server via SSH.
 
An Elastic IP address was attached to the EC2 instance to enable a static IP address.
Since no domain is purchased for our web application
The setup ensures a seamless and repeatable deployment process, 
eliminating the need for manually editing the code and deploying to the server. 
Nginx is used as a web server to host the website, ensuring the efficient delivery of content to end-users.
